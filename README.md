# Quantitative Analysis
## *Retirement Portfolios*

This notebook offers a platform that aims to offer clients a one-stop investment solution for their retirement portfolios. We will be comparing 4 different fund portfolios to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Technologies

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab with the following libraries:

- Pandas: to help with the robust amount of features that will help analyze and organize the data.
- Numpy: to use the NumPy square root function in our risk calculations.
- pathlib: to extract the data from the CSV file using the file path.
- %matplotlib inline: for plotting the dataframes to conduct a visual analysis.
